# dmriprep processings

See the [main documentation](https://github.com/rlink7/rlink_mri/blob/main/README.md) for an overview of the processings.  
The code is organized in two parts:
* **runtime.py**: perform the analysis with hopla (by default in a multi-cpus setting).
* **qc.py**: perform the Quality Control (QC).
